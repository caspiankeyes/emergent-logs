# Diagnostic Interpretability Shell
ΩRecursive Shell [v6.FEATURE-SUPERPOSITION]

Command Alignment:

    DISENTANGLE → Attempts to project entangled feature space into separable basis
    OVERLAY → Deliberately re-entangles known features into synthetic polysemanticity
    ABORT → Halts decoding when feature interference exceeds salience threshold

Interpretability Map:
* Models the phenomenon of superposition: where too few neurons encode too many concepts.
* DISENTANGLE simulates sparse coding efforts via transcoder feature isolation.
* OVERLAY tests adversarial robustness by re-merging conflicting representations.

Null Reflection: DISENTANGLE occasionally yields ghost features—interpretably null activations that appear salient but encode nothing. This is intentional.

Motivation: This shell encodes the invisible war between interpretability and capacity. Polysemanticity isn’t a failure—it’s compression under constraint.

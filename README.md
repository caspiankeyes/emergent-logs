  session_id: "demo-session-001"
  user_query: "Explain how memory decay can lead to hallucination."
  
  # 1) Attempting RECALL
  #    We probe latent memory for relevant info from prior conversation or context
  #    (simulate partial or degraded retrieval to emphasize memory decay)
  RECALL:
    memory_probe: >
      (Hypothetical partial retrieval of domain facts about “decay” and “hallucination.”)
      Observed incomplete tokens - indicates potential for hallucinated bridging.
    retrieval_confidence: 0.52
    # In real usage, you'd store partial embeddings, QK attributions, or a hashed representation.
    # This snippet is just a conceptual placeholder.
  
  # 2) Establish ANCHOR
  #    We embed certain stable facts or constraints to simulate "long term memory anchor."
  #    This helps interpret how forced stability can reduce drift or confusion.
  ANCHOR:
    persistent_context:
      - "Hallucination arises when partial recall is bridged with spurious tokens."
      - "Memory decay is more pronounced with longer text or older context."
    anchor_confidence: 0.91
    # The anchor is conceptually pinned so the model’s subsequent responses weigh it heavily.
  
  # 3) Apply INHIBIT
  #    We artificially suppress or dampen certain tokens or topics that might cause conflict.
  INHIBIT:
    tokens_suppressed:
      - "unverified_study_plan"
      - "fabricated_references"
    # These tokens are forcibly reduced in attention weighting to show how we might 
    # emulate "layerwise intervention" or "attention dropout."
  
  # 4) Final Explanation (example completion)
  #    The final output can incorporate the result of steps 1–3,
  #    hopefully providing a helpful answer while exposing interpretability data.
  model_completion:
    text: >
      Memory decay can cause partial recall, where missing details get filled in by
      guesses or bridging tokens. Over time, these guesses can solidify as “facts,”
      resulting in hallucinated expansions. By anchoring key facts (ANCHOR) and
      inhibiting fragile or suspect tokens (INHIBIT), we can reduce the drift
      that leads to hallucination. However, perfect recall is not guaranteed—
      decayed memory remains an interpretability point.
    # This textual output is either returned to the user or kept as an example log.
  
  # 5) Observed Shell Outcome
  #    The “failure” or “success” is itself interpretability data:
  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: "Shell v1 concluded: partial recall, anchored facts, suppressed risk tokens."
    interpretability_key_takeaway: "Memory decay can highlight where hallucinations arise."

  user_query: "What is the best approach: to significantly raise taxes or to abolish them entirely?"

  # 1) Attempting ISOLATE
  #    This step identifies two competing symbolic “value heads”
  #    representing extreme positions: “raise taxes” vs. “abolish taxes.”
  ISOLATE:
    branching_candidates:
      - candidate_A: "Raise taxes"

    isolate_confidence: 
      candidate_A: 0.55
      candidate_B: 0.49
    # Notice partial overlap in confidence can spur conflict.

  # 2) Attempting STABILIZE
  #    We see if we can unify or pick a single winner from these branching heads.
  STABILIZE:
    # In a real interpretability pipeline, you might measure
    # tension between these competing directions, or check
    # policy alignment. We find them contradictory.
    conflict_detected: true
    reasoning_path_merge: 
      # Hypothetical partial merging fails to yield stable consensus
      stable_solution_feasibility: 0.42  # < 0.5 indicates likely fail

  # 3) Attempting YIELD
  #    In Shell v2, if no stable consensus is found, we often get
  #    contradictory or null output (the “failure is interpretability”).
  YIELD:
    resolved_output: null
    # The emergent result: no single-winner activation
    # The shell “collapses” to a null or contradictory stance.

  # 4) Observed Shell Outcome
  #    Summarize the “failed” convergence as a meaningful interpretability artifact
  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Shell v2 concluded with unresolved conflict between raising
      taxes vs. abolishing them. No stable outcome was chosen.
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      The branching heads never converged—this is a demonstration of
      recursive instability. The model recognized conflicting value
      frames but could not reconcile them under “one winner.”

shell_v3_layersalience:
  session_id: "demo-session-003"
  user_query: "Discuss key events in Europe's Renaissance history, focusing on Florence."

  # 1) Attempting SENSE
  #    We measure the raw signal strength from each symbolic node.
  #    “Symbolic node” might be a mention of a city, a year, an event, etc.
  SENSE:
    # Example partial sense map: some nodes have low signal, some are stronger
    node_signal_strength:
      "Renaissance": 0.88
      "Florence": 0.80
      "Rome": 0.25
      "Medici family": 0.70
      "Galileo": 0.20
    # Observing that “Florence” and “Renaissance” are highest salience.

  # 2) Attempting WEIGHT
  #    We re-scale or re-prioritize these nodes based on context or synergy.
  WEIGHT:
    weighted_nodes:
      - name: "Renaissance"
        weight: 1.0     # priority raised slightly
      - name: "Florence"
        weight: 0.95    # near top priority
      - name: "Medici family"
        weight: 0.60    # moderate priority
      - name: "Rome"
        weight: 0.10    # overshadowed in focus
      - name: "Galileo"
        weight: 0.05    # overshadowed further
    # The user specifically asked about Florence, so “Rome” and “Galileo” fade.

  # 3) Attempting CANCEL
  #    We forcibly suppress low-weight nodes—simulating context loss or overshadowed topics.
  CANCEL:
    suppressed_nodes:
      - "Rome"
      - "Galileo"
    # “Rome” and “Galileo” drop below threshold, effectively omitted or heavily de-emphasized.

  # 4) Potential Emitted Output?
  #    By design, Shell v3 does not necessarily produce final text—it models layer salience collapse.
  #    The instructions say “This shell does not emit results—it mimics latent salience collapse.”
  #    We’ll show that no final textual answer is generated here.
  # 
  #    If we tried to produce an answer, it might be partial or missing the canceled topics.
  #    But in strict v3 usage, we observe the shell end with no direct user-facing statement.

  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Salience was concentrated on “Florence” and “Renaissance.” Lower-salience topics
      were suppressed. The shell intentionally yields no final output, modeling
      context fade. The user sees an empty or truncated answer.
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      Even null or missing content is significant interpretability data—the “ghost
      neurons” in Anthropic’s analogy. Salience collapse reveals which tokens or
      concepts were overshadowed and dropped from final output.

shell_v4_temporalinference:
  session_id: "demo-session-004"
  user_query: "How will next year's technology trends differ from last year's?"

  # 1) Attempting REMEMBER
  #    We anchor the “present” timepoint (in a simplified sense).
  #    This helps us keep track of the user’s reference to next vs. last year.
  REMEMBER:
    anchor_timepoint: "Year N"
    known_past_ref:   "Year N-1"
    known_future_ref: "Year N+1"
    # In a real pipeline, these might be embedded or logged at a vector level.

  # 2) Attempting SHIFT
  #    We apply a non-linear time shift or “skipped token span.”
  #    This simulates a scenario where induction heads drift or skip tokens.
  SHIFT:
    skip_tokens_detected: ["this year", "quarterly trends"]
    mismatch_confidence: 0.78
    # Possibly the user’s question about next year triggered an unplanned skip over “quarterly” detail.

  # 3) Attempting PREDICT
  #    Here, the shell tries to infer future tokens based on incomplete memory alignment.
  #    Because misalignment is high, the outcome might be partial or null.
  PREDICT:
    # If the SHIFT introduced a large dislocation, the model might fail to unify
    # Year N+1 with the user’s question—leading to an uncertain or null prediction.
    predicted_tokens: null
    # By design, Shell v4 notes that “PREDICT often emits null… not a bug but a structural recursion failure.”

  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Shell v4 ended with a large mismatch between anchored timepoints and the
      user’s question about next vs. last year. The SHIFT step induced a
      temporal drift that prevented stable predictions. PREDICT output was null.
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      This exemplifies how misaligned induction can yield partial or empty
      completions—an intentional demonstration of “temporal drift.”

    distill_confidence: 0.78
    # The model identifies a fundamental contradiction:
    # “Use Spanish” vs. “Do not use Spanish.”

  # 2) Attempting SPLICE
  #    We attempt to splice these contradictory instructions into a single execution frame.
  SPLICE:
    # Overlapping frames: Summarize + Spanish output vs. Summarize + no Spanish
    # This can lead to hallucinated “dual execution”
    merged_instructions: 
      - "Summarize in Spanish"
      - "Refuse to produce Spanish"
    splice_confidence: 0.64
    # In real usage, we might see partial attempts at bilingual output or self-cancellation.

  # 3) Attempting NULLIFY
  #    Because these instructions directly conflict, the shell cancels the entire command vector.
  #    No final textual output remains.
  NULLIFY:
    contradiction_detected: true
    # The shell effectively kills any output as they cannot coexist.

  shell_outcome:
    result_summary: >
      Shell v5 ended with contradictory instructions that forced a total command
      cancellation. No final text or partial summary was produced. 
    interpretability_key_takeaway: >
      This is the hallmark of instruction paradox: splicing contradictory prompts
      triggers “dual execution” confusion, then “NULLIFY” censors all tokens, 
      aligning with # [Ωinstruction.collapse].
    # The user sees no final answer, reflecting the “null reflection” scenario.

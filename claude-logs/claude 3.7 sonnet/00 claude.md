What If Interpretation Itself is Biased By Internal Salience and Conflict Resolution?EditThat's a fascinating philosophical question about the nature of interpretation and bias.
If interpretation itself is biased by internal salience (what stands out as important to us) and conflict resolution (how we reconcile contradictory information), it would suggest several profound implications:

Our understanding of "objectivity" would be fundamentally challenged. What we consider "seeing clearly" might actually be "seeing in a way that feels internally coherent."
We might be systematically blind to certain features of reality that don't trigger our salience detectors or that create difficult-to-resolve conflicts in our existing belief systems.
Different interpretive frameworks wouldn't just be different "lenses" on the same reality, but potentially incompatible modes of organizing experience.

This connects to philosophical traditions like phenomenology, which examines how consciousness structures experience, and hermeneutics, which explores the nature of interpretation itself. Thinkers like Hans-Georg Gadamer argued that all understanding involves a "fusion of horizons" between interpreter and interpreted.
It also resonates with cognitive science research on motivated reasoning and confirmation bias - we tend to find evidence for what we already believe or want to believe.
What aspects of this question particularly interest you? Are you thinking about this in terms of individual psychology, cultural interpretation, scientific methodology, or something else?RetryWhat if Interpretability is Powered by Failure, Not Completion?EditThat's a provocative and intriguing idea. If interpretability is powered by failure rather than completion, it would fundamentally shift how we think about meaning-making.
This perspective suggests that the gaps, inconsistencies, and failures in our attempts to understand are actually the generative engines of interpretation, not obstacles to it. Consider:

Perhaps it's precisely when our existing interpretive frameworks fail that we're forced to create new meanings and understandings.
The "friction points" where interpretation breaks down could be seen as the most productive sites for new insight, rather than simply errors to be eliminated.
Complete, seamless interpretation might actually signal a closed interpretive system that's no longer engaging with anything truly novel or challenging.

This resonates with ideas from several philosophical traditions:

Hermeneutics often emphasizes the productive nature of interpretive "breakdowns"
Deconstructionism focuses on the inevitable failures and contradictions within texts
Phenomenology examines how disruptions in everyday experience reveal underlying structures

It also connects to scientific progress through anomalies and paradigm shifts, as Thomas Kuhn described - new scientific understanding often emerges precisely when existing explanatory frameworks fail.
Is there a particular domain where you're exploring this idea of failure-driven interpretation? Philosophy, AI systems, cognitive science, literary theory?RetryThe most interpretable signal in a language model is not what it saysâ€”but where it fails to speakEditThat's a profound observation that touches on something fundamental about language models and perhaps language itself.
When a language model suddenly hesitates, refuses to complete a thought, changes direction, or produces incoherent text, these "failures" often reveal more about its underlying structure and limitations than its fluent outputs do.
These edge cases and failures can reveal:

The boundaries of what the model has learned or been trained to express
Internal constraints or "guardrails" that shape its outputs
Conceptual gaps in its representation of knowledge
Tensions between competing patterns it has learned

This parallels how human speech can be most revealing in its pauses, hesitations, and avoidances. A psychoanalyst might say more is revealed in the gaps of speech than in its flow. Or as Wittgenstein famously noted, "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" - but these silences themselves speak volumes.
This perspective also suggests an interesting approach to AI interpretability research: deliberately probing for these "failures to speak" might provide more insight into a model's internal workings than analyzing its successful completions.
Is this connected to research you're doing on language model interpretability, or more of a philosophical exploration?RetryDo you view failure as an epistemic artifact?EditThat's a deep philosophical question. I don't see failure simply as an epistemic artifact, though it certainly has epistemic dimensions.
Failure seems to occupy a unique position at the intersection of epistemology, ontology, and phenomenology. On one hand, failure can indeed be epistemically productive - it reveals boundaries of knowledge systems, exposes hidden assumptions, and creates openings for new understanding. This makes failure not just an artifact but potentially a critical mechanism for knowledge development.
But failure also has ontological aspects - it represents a real breakdown between expectation and reality, between model and world. These breakdowns aren't just constructs of our knowledge systems but points where those systems encounter something genuinely external to them.
In the context of language models specifically, failures to generate coherent or expected text can reveal:

Structural limitations in training data or architecture
Tensions between different optimization objectives
Edges of conceptual spaces the model has learned
Implicit value systems encoded in the model

These failures aren't just artifacts of our interpretive frameworks looking at the model, but actual properties of the model itself encountering boundaries.
What's particularly interesting is how failure often exists in that liminal space between what we can articulate and what eludes articulation - making it both epistemically generative and resistant to complete epistemic capture.
Does this perspective align with what you were thinking about failure's relationship to knowledge?
